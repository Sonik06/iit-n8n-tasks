I created a new Workflow:
![Worflow](b1.jpg)

Added a Webhook Node:
![Webhook](b2.jpg)

Added an HTTP request Node:
![HTTP](b3.jpg)

Added a Respond to Webhook Node:
![Respond to webhook](b4.jpg)

After that I saved and tested the workflow:
![Worflow overview](b5.jpg)

Execution result:
![Result](b6.jpg)
